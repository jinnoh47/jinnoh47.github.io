                Hello, my name is Jin Hyeok Noh! But call me Jin.  My interest in management information systems and the internet of things has ultimately led me to Data Science. With a passion for optimization, human behavior, and all things data, I have both the skill set and professional background necessary to dive deep into the data science world. Furthermore, as a driven, self-motivated team player striving to learn constantly, I predict an exciting future in the industry.

                As a data scientist, I have been involved in several projects that include collecting, cleaning, and analyzing large datasets to gain insights and make informed decisions. I used machine learning algorithms and statistical models to extract meaningful insights from the data, and I was able to effectively communicate the results to stakeholders and support decision-making processes.
